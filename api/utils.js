function requireUser( req, res, next ) {
    if ( !req.user ) {
        next({
            name: "MissingUserError",
            message: "You must be logger in to perform this action"
        });

module.exports = {
    requireUser
}

/*
It's pretty straight forward, if the req.user hasn't been set 
(which means a correct auth token wasn't sent in with the request),
 we will send an error rather than moving on to the actual request. 
 Otherwise, we pass on to the next thing like nothing happened.

Writing this function will allow us to reuse it in multiple places,
 and one way you can use it is like this:

    someRouter.post('/some/route', requireUser, async (req, res, next) => {

    });

When you pass in multiple functions after the route string, 
it will attach each as middleware in the order they are specified. 
This means that when a user posts to /some/route, the requireUser 
middleware will be called first, and then if next() is called cleanly 
from requireUser, our anonymous middleware function will be called.
